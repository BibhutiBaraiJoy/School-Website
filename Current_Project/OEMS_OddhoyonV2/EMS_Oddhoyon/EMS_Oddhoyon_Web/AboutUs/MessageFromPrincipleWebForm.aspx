          <p style="text-align: justify;">I am pleased to inform all stake holders of Barisal Model School and College that with the auspicious guideline and suggestion of the Board of Governors, the institution could have unleash its inter active web service. I am optimistic that the web system would maintain its standard and everyone’s expectations by continuing its wonderful service a magnificent radiance all the way. The academic, social and all co-curricular tales of the school and college are indeed going to be chronicled as a priceless treasure through it.</p>
         <p style="text-align: justify;">The web site signals the start of an eventful academic year of Barisal Model School and College. I therefore, take this opportunity to welcome all students and guardians to be the part of this interactive system. I am convinced beyond any reasonable doubt that, it will put all good, effective and urgent news and knowledge from where students would be able to gather acquired formal academic result, syllabus, routine, settings and information as well as interaction opportunities that this institution would offer. To this end, may I also thank the committee members and staffs of the college for their commitment and hard work throughout the year.</p>
         <p style="text-align: justify;">I wish all students’ best future; you all go to take up your new lives which may require you to shoulder greater responsibilities than the ones you had before.</p>
         <p style="text-align: justify;">May Allah-the omnipotent bestow His divine and peace to all of us.</p>
